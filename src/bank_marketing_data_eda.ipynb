We will try to spot this class so we make sure we capture as many customers as we can with this term deposit product.

If we can tune our prediction model to minimize false negatives, the more customers we hope we can get signed up this term deposit product.\n",

This will also be dependent on our initial tuning to see if any metrics identify any other problems.\n",

    "To gain an understanding on which features could be helpful in predicting the positive class, we plotted histograms of numeric features (didn't subscibe: blue and subscibed: orange) and percent subscribed bar graphs for each of the categorical features for all observations in the training data set. Although the histograms distributions for all of the numeric features overlap to a certain degree, they do show a difference in their centres and spreads, for example, `age` histogram. For the categorical features, some features are similar in the proportion subscribed, while others seem to be promising in predicting the positive class. The `poutcome` (previous outcome) feature seem to be the best as previous success is highly associated with the positive class. In addition, the features values (`contact`: cellphone, `education`:illitrate, `age_category`:older adults then young adults, and `job`s:retired and student) seem to be associated with the positive class. \n"
